# Java Dash of the Dead: a Java game for the Java of the dead Pokitto game jam

## Day 1

Initial design phase. I'm thinking of a dash/runner game. 

Torbuntu (hehe yeah I'm going to be a character) wakes up to discover that the world has changed. The dead have come back to life! And they want his brains (well, that is what he thinks). He quickly bursts from bed and runs away from the zombie menace. 

Running while tired is a challenge, so Torbuntu must collect coffee drinks to stay awake! 
#### Energy meter that depletes without recharging by collecting randomly placed coffee drinks

Obstacles may become a problem, so Torbuntu must dash through them! 
#### Doors to buildings, Fences doors, Windows ;), etc...

See how far Torbuntu can get before running out of energy or slamming into a solid surface. 

#### Possible upgrade mechanics include: Higher jump, double jump, dash distance, dash power, energy depletion slow down, bigger energy bar.

## Next Day

The story evolves. The plan is to be running through the castle of a Vampire. You are trying to collec the treasure strewn about the castle without getting caught. Bats and other
strange beasts are wandering the halls of the castle, you must dodge them while collecting the precious loot!
